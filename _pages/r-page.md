# Intro to R, from RStudio to OLS. 

The following is an introductory course to R, based on the probability and regression class taught at the Ralph Bunche Summer Institute in 2021, 2022, and 2023. The course is designed to complement a lecture series on hypothesis generatoin, empirical measurement, statistical inference, and regressions. The outline is as follows:

1. What is Data and Where to Find it?
2. Intro to R and RStudio [link](lab2.html)
3. Data Cleaning and Management
4. Ordinary Least Squares in R
5. Interpreting and Graphing Results in R

Teaching
Research plays a central role in my teaching as students improve their analytical skills and master the tools of data analysis through hands-on experience. I have taught undergraduate courses on political violence and statistical methodology. While at UNC, I taught the graduate statistics lab for Advanced Topics in Political Data Science, where my work was recognized by the Political Science Department’s Earle Wallace Award for Graduate Student Teaching. I also served as a teaching assistant for courses in international relations and American politics at UNC, in addition to the ICPSR Summer Program where I was a teaching assistant for a course on Bayesian modeling in the social sciences. I am also a certified instructor with The Carpentries, which develops evidence-based methods for teaching “essential data and computational skills for conducting efficient, open, and reproducible research.”
