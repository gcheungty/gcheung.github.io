### About me

I'm a PhD candidate in Political Science at Duke University. 

I study dictators, the strategies and tactics that authoritarian leaders use to consolidate power. I tackle these questions using a mix of qualitative archival work to build theories, and empirical data covering over 300 dictators. 

You can hire me! Check out my [CV](https://www.gloria.cheung.com/cv/)
