### About me

I'm a PhD candidate in Political Science at Duke University, graduating in 2024.

I study dictators, the strategies and tactics that authoritarian leaders use to consolidate power. I tackle these questions using a mix of qualitative archival work to build theories, and empirical data covering over 300 dictators. 

My research interests can broadly be categorized as being in comparative authoritarian politics, democratic backsliding, and strategic political behaviour.
